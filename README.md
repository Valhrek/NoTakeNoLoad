# NoTakeNoLoad
A simple Wurm mod designed to allow GMs to mark off-deed items such that players will no longer be able to load them into their vehicles.

To prevent an item from being loaded, use your GM wand to manage item restrictions selecting both 'No Take' and 'Not Moveable'. The item should no longer be able to be loaded in any vehicle.
